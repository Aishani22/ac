                    <h3>CLASSY BATSMAN!</h3>
                    <p>Kane Williamson is widely considered as one of the most pleasing batsman to watch when in full flow. Known for his trademark backfoot punches and dab to third man shots and playing the ball late, just below his eyes...More often than not he steadies the ship during batting collapses and does the major run scoring. Steps up in difficult match situations and has many iconic knocks to his name. He loves "yeah..." while batting!</p>

                    <h3>HANDY OFF-SPIN BOWLER!</h3>
                    <p>Kane Williamson is also a handy off-spinner. Finds it a bit difficult to keep his arm straight while bowling but has been decent with bowl too! He has the best economy for any New Zealand spinner in SENA tests. Becomes much more excited when he almost gets a wicket than when he scores a hundred! Rarely bowls himself since becoming the captain. :(</p>

                    <h3>UNDERRATED GUN FIELDER!</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes Steady the Ship also tunrns into a plane. Kiwis are called the flightless birds but this Kiwi can fly too! Usually fielding at mid-off and at gully in tests, Kane has taken many stunners and blinders and made them look so easy with his ordinary celebrations. Has got ice in his veins even while taking sky high catches! </p>
